Worked on the TimedAction class, working on the timing. ared is good, still need to fine tune the green LED timing.
    - [ ] Find out why the green LED is only on for 1.96s instead of 2s. Is it a timing issue or a hardware issue?
    - [ ] Once timing is fixed, verify with read data on the bench instead of the desk.
